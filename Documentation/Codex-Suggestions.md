# Codex Suggestions for Scal.Interpreting.Commands

## Context

This document summarizes feature suggestions and a lightweight impact/effort analysis based on the current project positioning:

- deterministic verb/noun grammar and resolution
- strongly typed command modeling
- DataAnnotations validation
- contextual feedback/help generation
- response file support

---

## Feature suggestions

Based on the current scope (deterministic verb/noun resolution, typed params, DataAnnotations, contextual help, response files), here are concise feature ideas:

- Shell completion generation (Bash/PowerShell/Zsh).
- Built-in typo suggestions (“Did you mean …?” for verb/noun/param).
- Command aliases (stable synonyms, not only abbreviations).
- Default values from environment variables (e.g., APP_REGION), or from dictionary or custom delegate.
- Mutually-exclusive parameter groups (first-class conflict rules).
- Dry-run / parse-only mode (validate + show bound command without execute).
- Localization for help/errors (multilingual CLI UX).
- Pluggable error formatter (plain, JSON, CI-friendly output).
- Response-file cycle diagnostics (show include chain when depth exceeded).
- Command discovery export (machine-readable schema/OpenAPI-like for CLIs).

Other possible features (Scal):

- Ignore dashes inside parameters (`--dry-run` with property `DryRun`).
- Interpretation logging using `EventSource` with specific event Id's.
- Multiple commands (batch interpreter) with context.
- Allow commands discovery in specific assemblies other than the one of the base class.
- Command, verb and parameters minimum length with grobal default (currently 1).
- Preprocessing for parameters required before command instantiation with DI.
- Help for enum-based parameters.
- Array parameters (can currently be achived with adhoc property parsing).
- Default command when no paramater supplied.

## Clarification on already-possible behaviors

### Dry-run
A practical dry-run mode already exists by calling `Interpret<T>(args)` and intentionally not executing the instantiated command.

### Error formatting
Output customization is already possible through `Feedback(Action<string>)`, i.e., caller-controlled formatting/sinks via delegate.

### Mutually-exclusive parameter groups

Your current approach already models exclusivity implicitly by using separate command types, and the tests prove it.
`ListImageByType` and `ListImageByNamespace` are selected based on differing parameter sets under same verb/noun.\
But see **Parameter relationship rules** below.

## Feature suggestions (impact vs effort)

### High impact / Low-to-Medium effort (recommended first)

1. **Typo suggestions** (`Unknown command` / unknown parameter → closest matches)
   - **Impact:** High UX improvement, fewer support issues.
   - **Effort:** Medium (string similarity + ranking + tests).
   - **Rationale:** Naturally integrates with existing unknown/ambiguous command handling.

2. **Stable command aliases** (explicit synonyms, distinct from abbreviations)
   - **Impact:** High for documentation and script stability over time.
   - **Effort:** Medium (metadata + match precedence rules).
   - **Rationale:** Complements current abbreviation behavior, which is intentionally adaptive.

3. **Environment variable binding fallback** (opt-in per parameter/property)
   - **Impact:** High for CI/CD and containerized usage.
   - **Effort:** Medium (attribute design + precedence strategy).
   - **Rationale:** Extends typed binding without weakening deterministic CLI semantics.

### Medium impact / Low effort (quick wins)

4. **Machine-readable help output** (e.g., JSON)
   - **Impact:** Medium (tooling automation, wrapper tooling, UIs).
   - **Effort:** Low-to-medium.
   - **Rationale:** Existing command/parameter model already exposes the structure needed.

5. **Richer response-file diagnostics** (include chain, nested path trace, line numbers)
   - **Impact:** Medium (debuggability in larger CLI setups).
   - **Effort:** Low.
   - **Rationale:** Builds on existing response-file recursion/depth mechanisms.

### High impact / Higher effort (strategic)

6. **Shell completion generation** (Bash/Zsh/PowerShell)
   - **Impact:** High daily usability for interactive users.
   - **Effort:** High (cross-shell generation/testing and packaging).
   - **Rationale:** Leverages existing command/parameter metadata.

7. **Parameter relationship rules**
   - Examples: mutually exclusive groups, requires-with, one-of groups.
   - **Impact:** High for complex command surfaces and correctness.
   - **Effort:** High (new validation abstractions + conflict reporting UX).
   - **Rationale:** Strong alignment with model-first design intent.

   What I had in mind was a different layer: explicit XOR rules **inside one command model**, e.g.:
   - `RequireExactlyOneOf(TypeId, Namespace)`
   - `ForbidTogether(Name, Regex)`
   - `RequireAtLeastOneOf(File, Stdin)`
   
   So the value is:
   - fewer “mirror” command classes when behavior is same,
   - clearer validation message (“TypeId and Namespace are mutually exclusive”),
   - declarative business rules beyond just command discrimination.

   So: your mechanism = `type-level exclusivity` (already strong).
   
   Suggested addition = `rule-level exclusivity` (complements it).

## Suggested implementation order

1. Typo suggestions
2. Stable aliases
3. Environment variable binding
4. JSON help output
5. Response-file diagnostics
6. Shell completion generation
7. Parameter relationship rules

## Optional next step

If useful, this can be converted into a milestone roadmap (`vNext`, `vNext+1`) with:

- acceptance criteria per feature
- compatibility constraints
- test matrix and sample CLI scenarios
